# tremaux-maze-follower
This code is an application of Tremaux Algorithm. It was designed for a maze-solving robot attending to BROCUP competition. This code creates an array simulation to test the validity of the algorithm. This repository also has a file that helps the robot solve the maze in the second round more quickly by eliminating false paths.
